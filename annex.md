\* Where a range of ODPs is indicated, the highest value in that range shall be used for the purpose of the Protocol.
The ODPs listed as a single value have been determined from calculations based on laboratory measurements.
Those listed as a range are based on estimates and are less certain.
The range pertains to an isomeric group.
The upper value is the estimate of the ODP of the isomer with the highest ODP, and the lower value is the estimate of the ODP of the isomer with the lowest ODP.

\** Identifies the most commercially viable substances with ODP values listed against them to be used for the purposes of the Protocol.
