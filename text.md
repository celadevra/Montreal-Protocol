# Preamble

The Parties to this Protocol,

*Being* Parties to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer,

*Mindful* of their obligation under that Convention to take appropriate measures to protect human health and the environment against adverse effects resulting or likely to result from human activities which modify or are likely to modify the ozone layer,

*Recognizing* that world-wide emissions of certain substances can significantly deplete and otherwise modify the ozone layer in a manner that is likely to result in adverse effects on human health and the environment,

*Conscious* of the potential climatic effects of emissions of these substances,

*Aware* that measures taken to protect the ozone layer from depletion should be based on relevant scientific knowledge, taking into account technical and economic considerations,

*Determined* to protect the ozone layer by taking precautionary measures to control equitably total global emissions of substances that deplete it, with the ultimate objective of their elimination on the basis of developments in scientific knowledge, taking into account technical and economic considerations and bearing in mind the developmental needs of developing countries,

*Acknowledging* that special provision is required to meet the needs of developing countries, including the provision of additional financial resources and access to relevant technologies, bearing in mind that the magnitude of funds necessary is predictable, and the funds can be expected to make a substantial difference in the world‟s ability to address the scientifically established problem of ozone depletion and its harmful effects,

*Noting* the precautionary measures for controlling emissions of certain chlorofluorocarbons that have already been taken at national and regional levels,

*Considering* the importance of promoting international co-operation in the research, development and transfer of alternative technologies relating to the control and reduction of emissions of substances that deplete the ozone layer, bearing in mind in particular the needs of developing countries,

HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:
